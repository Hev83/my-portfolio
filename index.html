    <h1>About me</h1>
    </section>

        <p>I am aspiring to be a Web and Software Developer 
             by the end of the year. As I enjoy creating and building webpages by using
             HTML/CSS and Python for doing the coding I like the way they make everything 
             come together that I have created.
           I have also like to way 3DS maxs made my art come to life which I have always had 
             an creative mind where I can look at something to see what could be made. Which why 
             I like the way HTML/CSS and JavaScript works.
           My Passion for software Development started from when my Family 
             started to open their own company and I help them set up there Social media.
             I then started to look into how to create a webpage so I had a look online to see how 
             HTML and CSS worked</P>
